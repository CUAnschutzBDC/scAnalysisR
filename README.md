# scAnalysisR 
A package to perform single cell analysis using various tools. The package centers around using `Seurat` objects and has functions for preprocessing, plotting, running differential expression and gene ontology, and naming popultions.

This package works with `Seurat` version 3 objects.

If you use this package for your own analysis, please acknowledge this repository. You can also consider citing my eLife paper. The package I wrote for that paper was updated to work with `Seurat` version 3 objects here.
